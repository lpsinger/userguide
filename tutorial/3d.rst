Distance and 3D Sky Maps
========================

All localization FITS files for CBC events are three dimensional: they include
both the sky probability map and a directionally dependent distance estimate.
This can be useful for identifying possible host galaxies using a galaxy
redshift catalog. For further details see `Singer et al. (2016a)`_ and for
sample code see `Singer et al. (2016b)`_.
