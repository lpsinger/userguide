    LHO
        LIGO Hanford Observatory (see `observatory home page
        <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LA>`_), site of a 4 km gravitational-wave
        detector in Hanford, Washington, USA.

    LLO
        LIGO Livingston Observatory (see `observatory home page
        <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA>`_), site of a 4 km gravitational-wave
        detector in Livingston, Louisiana, USA.

    GCN

        electromagnetic wavelengths and also gravitational-wave, cosmic ray,
        and neutrino facilities.

    GCN Circular
        A human-readable astronomical bulletin distributed through :term:`GCN`.

    GCN Notice
        A machine-readable alert distributed through :term:`GCN`.

    GraceDb
        Gravitational Wave Candidate Event Database (https://gracedb.ligo.org),
        the official public marshal portal for LIGO/Virgo candidates.

    Virgo
        Virgo Observatory (see `observatory home page
        <http://www.virgo-gw.eu>`_), site of a 3 km gravitational-wave detector
        in Cascina, Italy.
