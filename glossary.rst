    LHO
        LIGO Hanford Observatory (see `LHO observatory home page
        <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LA>`_), site of a 4 km gravitational-wave
        detector in Hanford, Washington, USA.

    LLO
        LIGO Livingston Observatory (see `LLO observatory home page
        <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA>`_), site of a 4 km gravitational-wave
        detector in Livingston, Louisiana, USA.

    GCN
        The Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov), a portal
        for discoveries and observations of astronomical transients.
        Historically, GCN has served high-energy satellites but now also other
        electromagnetic wavelengths and also gravitational-wave, cosmic ray,
        and neutrino facilities.

    GCN Circular
        A human-readable astronomical bulletin distributed through :term:`GCN`.

    GCN Notice
        A machine-readable alert distributed through :term:`GCN`.

    GraceDb
        Gravitational Wave Candidate Event Database (https://gracedb.ligo.org),
        the official public marshal portal for LIGO/Virgo candidates.

    HEALPix
        Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation, a scheme for indexing
        positions on the unit sphere.

    Virgo
        Virgo Observatory (see `Virgo observatory home page
        <http://www.virgo-gw.eu>`_), site of a 3 km gravitational-wave detector
        in Cascina, Italy.

    VTP
        VOEvent Transport Protocol, a simple TCP-based protocol for sending and
        receiving VOEvents, used by :term:`GCN`. See the `IVOA recommendation
        <http://www.ivoa.net/documents/Notes/VOEventTransport/>`_ for details.
