Getting Started Checklist
=========================

In addition to reading this user guide, we encourage you to sign up for certain
e-mail lists and community resources. Make sure that you have completed the
items on this checklist.

1. Read This User Guide
-----------------------

Pay particular attention to the :doc:`content` section of this user guide to
familiarize yourself with the contents of machine-readable LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA
:term:`GCN Notices <GCN Notice>`. Play with the :doc:`tutorial/index` to
receive example GCN Notices and practice working with :doc:`sky localization
maps <tutorial/skymaps>`.

2. Subscribe to GCN Circulars
-----------------------------

`Subscribe to GCN Circulars`_ and review the `instructions for posting GCN
Circulars`_. A :term:`GCN Circular` is a short, public bulletin to rapidly
report an astronomical observation. GCN Circulars are distributed by email and
`archived online`_. [#f1]_ LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA uses GCN Circulars to announce
detections, and the astronomy community expects participants to promptly
disseminate preliminary reports of follow-up observations of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA
counterparts using GCN Circulars as well.

.. important::
   GCN Circulars can only be posted from registered email addresses. You
   *must* sign up for GCN Circulars *in advance* in order to post to the list.

3. Join the OpenLVEM Community
------------------------------

Sign up to the OpenLVEM mailing list by following the `OpenLVEM instructions`_.
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA will use this list to make announcements and solicit input. It
is also a great place to ask questions or discuss issues related to
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA public alerts. Documents relating to teleconferences and
in-person meetings are available at `OpenLVEM wiki`_.

4. Visit GraceDB
----------------

Familiarize yourself with GraceDB_, LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA's online portal for alerts
and real-time results.

.. [#f1] GCN Circulars are similar to `Astronomer's Telegrams`_ (ATels). By
         longstanding convention, the gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave
         astronomy communities use GCNs, whereas the supernova community uses
         ATels.
