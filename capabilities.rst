Observational Capabilities
==========================

This section summarizes the observing capabilities of the global
gravitational-wave detector network as of late 2018. This as a quick reference
to the anticipated commissioning and observing schedule, sensitivity to
gravitational-wave transients, and sky localization accuracy, as described in
the following external documents:

Timeline
--------

There will be two Engineering Runs as LIGO/Virgo transitions from commissioning
to full-time observations. Engineering Run 13 (ER13) is scheduled to start
2017-12-17 and last about 5 days. Engineering Run 14 (ER14) is scheduled for
the middle of January and will transition without interruption to Observing Run
3 (O3).

During both Engineering Runs, the detectors and analysis software will
be changing frequently. Consequently, during the Engineering Runs, we will send
public alerts only for highly confident and scientifically significant events
and with longer than normal latency.

Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3) is scheduled to
begin in February 2019. We expect that all three detectors will observe
continuously and without significant interruptions for one year.

It is possible that the Japanese KAGRA detector may come online and become part
of the joint gravitational-wave analysis at some point during O3.

The observing schedule as it is currently envisioned is shown in the timeline
below.

Sensitivity and Localization Accuracy
-------------------------------------

With expected ranges of the LIGO, Virgo and Kagra detectors as supplied in the
the table below, a total of 1-50 BNS events during their operation is
anticipated. It is also expected that the 90% median credible region of
sky-localization for the BNS sources during O3 is 120-180 square degrees, with
12-21% of these events to have 90% credible regions smaller than 20 square
degrees. More information is available in this `Living Review Article
