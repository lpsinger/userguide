Observational Capabilities
==========================

Timeline
--------

* To prepare the Observation Run, we schedule two differents Engineering runs. The first one (ER13) will be attempted to start on Monday, the 17th of December, to last around 5 days. The second one (ER14) is scheduled for the middle of January, and without interruption will switch to the Observing Run.
* The third Observational run of aLIGO/AdV called O3 is scheduled to begin in February 2019. O3 is expected to be a year long run with the LIGO detectors and the Virgo detector. 
* The expected schedule of operation is given below:

Different Observatories
-----------------------

* While aLIGO and AdV will follow the same schedule, they might be joined by KAGRA in 2019 (link?).

Prospects for observation and localization sensitivity:
-------------------------------------------------------

* With expected ranges of the LIGO, Virgo and Kagra detectors as supplied in the
  the table below, a total of 1-50 BNS events during their operation is anticipated.
  It is also expected that the 90% median credible region of sky-localization
  for the BNS sources during O3 is 120-180 square degrees, with 12-21% of
  these events to have 90% credible regions smaller than 20 square degrees.
