Observational Capabilities
==========================

Timeline
* To prepare the Observation Run, we schedule two differents Engineering runs. The first one (ER13) will be attempted to start on Monday, the 17th of December, to last around 5 days. The second one (ER14) is scheduled for the middle of January, and without interruption will switch to the Observing Run.
* The third Observational run of aLIGO/AdV called O3 is scheduled to begin in February 2019. O3 is expected to be a year long run with the LIGO detectors and the Virgo detector. 
* Updtated schedule available online: https://dcc.ligo.org/DocDB/0152/G1800889/005/G1800889-v5.pdf

Different Observatories
* While aLIGO and AdV will follow the same schedule, they might be join by KAGRA (link?). It will be fully operational by early
  2019 and will become part of the global network with full data sharing once its sensitivities are commensurate to that of LIGO and Virgo. 

Prospects for observation and localization sensitivity:
  The LIGO detectors are expected to have BNS range of 20-170 Mpc
  where as the Virgo detector is expected to have BNS range of 65-85 Mpc for
  CBC sources. For burst sources, the LIGO and the Virgo detectors are
  expected to have BNS range of 75-90 Mpc and 40-50 Mpc respectively. These
  results in a total of 1-50 BNS events during their operation.
  It is also expected that the 90% median credible region of sky-localization
  for the BNS sources during O3 is 120-180 square degrees, with 12-21% of
  these events to have 90% credible regions smaller than 20 square degrees.

  We expect that Kagra will join with a BNS range of 8-25 Mpc.
