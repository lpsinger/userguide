Observational Capabilities
==========================

Should mention:

  * Dates of O3:
      LIGO-Virgo's observing run is scheduled to begin in February 2019
  * Working schedule for O3 and dates for ER13 and ER14:
      LIGO-Virgo's Engineering runs (ER13 and ER14) are scheduled to be in
      December 2018 - January 2019

  * Prospects for observation and localization sensitivity:
      O3 is expected to be a year long run with the LIGO detectors and the Virgo
      detector. The LIGO detectors are expected to have BNS range of 20-170 Mpc
      where as the Virgo detector is expected to have BNS range of 65-85 Mpc for
      CBC sources. For burst sources, the LIGO and the Virgo detectors are
      expected to have BNS range of 75-90 Mpc and 40-50 Mpc respectively. These
      results in a total of 1-50 BNS events during their operation.
      It is also expected that the 90% median credible region of sky-localization
      for the BNS sources during O3 is 120-180 square degrees, with 12-21% of
      these events to have 90% credible regions smaller than 20 square degrees.

  * KAGRA:
      It is expected that Kagra will join, and be fully operational by early
      2019 and will become part of the global network with full data sharing
      once its sensitivities are commensurate to that of LIGO and Virgo. We
      expect that Kagra will join with a BNS range of 8-25 Mpc.
