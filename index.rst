Welcome to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide! This document is intended
for both professional astronomers and science enthusiasts who are interested in
receiving alerts and real-time data products related to gravitational-wave (GW)
events.

Three sites (:term:`LHO`, :term:`LLO`, :term:`Virgo`) together form a global
network of ground-based GW detectors. The `LIGO Scientific Collaboration`_ and
the `Virgo Collaboration`_ jointly analyze the data in real time to detect and
localize transients from compact binary mergers and other sources. When a
signal candidate is found, an alert is sent to astronomers in order to search
for counterparts (electromagnetic waves or neutrinos).

`Advanced LIGO`_ and `Advanced Virgo`_ began their third observing run (O3) on
April 1, 2019. **Observations were suspended on March 27, 2020, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.** Observing schedule updates will be posted once it is known
when it will be safe to resume normal activities at the sites.

**LIGO/Virgo alerts are public**. Alerts are distributed through NASA's
Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (:term:`GCN`). There are two types of alerts:
human-readable :term:`GCN Circulars <GCN Circular>` and machine-readable
:term:`GCN Notices <GCN Notice>`. This document provides a brief overview of
the procedures for vetting and sending GW alerts, describes their contents and
format, and includes instructions and sample code for receiving GCN Notices and
decoding GW sky maps.
