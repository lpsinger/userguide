Alert Content
=============

Should mention:

  * Description of the notices: https://wiki.ligo.org/Bursts/EMFollow/O3GCNnotices
  * Description of the circulars
  * also some info here https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G1800404/public



Event name
----------

Events will be labeled based on the trigger time (...).


Significance
------------

The significance of the event will be given in the form of a associated False Alarm Rate (FAR), that is the expected rate of events with the same significance due to noise only. If the estimated FAR is less than one in a hundred years, the event will be simply described as "highly significant". Otherwise, the FAR number will be stated in the circular.

Source classification
---------------------

If the event is identified as a Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC), a source classification is provided. The classification is a qualitative statement whether the signal is consistent with a Binary of two Neutron Stars (BNS), of a Black Hole and a Neutron Star (NSBH or BHNS) or of two Black Holes (BBH). Additional information may be provided, if available: 

  * the probability that the least massive member of the binary has a mass consistent with a Neutron Star (NS);
  * the probability that some mass is left outside the remnant (we label this probability "EM bright", since the presence of mass makes the possibility of electro-magnetic emission more likely);
  * the probability ("P_astro") that the event is of astrophysical origin based on both the noise background properties and the observed CBC rate.

Data quality assessment
-----------------------

Circulars may contain concise descriptions of any instrument or data quality issues that may affect the significance estimates or the GW parameter inferences. Unresolved data quality issues could mean that localization estimates may shift after they have been mitigated, but does not mean that they will. This is to be considered as advisory information.

What will *not* be included in the alerts
-----------------------------------------

The alerts are not going to release quantitative estimates of intrinsic properties such as masses and spins, nor contain information on the GW strain or reconstructed waveforms.
