Early-Warning Alerts
====================

:term:`BNS` mergers spend several minutes in band of the Advanced ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors.  For some loud and nearby :term:`BNS`
mergers, it is possible to accumulate enough :term:`SNR` and detect them
several tens of seconds before merger.  During O3, automated public alerts for
:term:`CBC` events have been sent within as little as 2 minutes after merger.
In O4, we have commissioned search pipelines that can detect
:term:`BNS` events before merger if the signal is sufficiently strong. 

Since it is generally assumed that detectable electromagnetic (or neutrino)
emission starts shortly *after* merger, a pre-merger gravitational-wave
detection would provide *early warning* of an impending electromagnetic
transient and might make it possible for automated follow-up facilities to
capture any prompt emission from the merger environment, the jet, and other
unknown activity.

We had previously conducted a trial early warning public alert infrastructure
in June 2020 replaying an 8-day period of archival LIGO data from O3. Results
from this study were published in [#FirstDemonstration]_. This study
demonstrated that in principle it is possible to send out GCN Notices in
advance of a BNS merger. 

Detection Method
----------------

All of our :term:`CBC` search pipelines (GstLAL [#GstLALEarlyWarning]_, MBTA,
PyCBC [#PYCBCEWForeCast]_, and SPIIR) are participating in early-warning alerts. See the
:doc:`content` section for details about alert types and contents. See the
:doc:`analysis/searches` section for details
on these analyses. Localizations will be produced with BAYESTAR; see the
:doc:`analysis/parameter_estimation` section for details.

:term:`BNS` signals sweep up smoothly in frequency for a few minutes across the
Advanced LIGO band. In that time, they may accumulate enough :term:`SNR` to be detected
before merger. A GW170817-like system with a total network :term:`SNR` of 32 will
already accumulate an :term:`SNR` of 11 by the time the signal sweeps up to 30 Hz,
about a minute before merger.

   The time evolution of the gravitational-wave frequency and the cumulative
   :term:`SNR` for a GW170817-like :term:`BNS` system.


The early warning search is a matched-filter search that uses templates that
have been truncated at a selection of end frequencies---or equivalently, cut
off at a selection of times before merger. The following tables give, for each
search pipeline, the ending frequencies and corresponding times before merger.
The relationship between frequency and time is approximate and assumes
a :term:`BNS` with masses :math:`1.4 \, M_\odot` and :math:`1.4 \, M_\odot`.

Source Classification
---------------------
The automated :doc:`source classification and properties <analysis/inference>`
have not been trained or tested extensively for early warning alerts. However,
the early warning analysis is **only sensitive to BNS-mass mergers**. As a
result, the favored source class in early warning GCN Notices will always be
either BNS or Terrestrial, with a 0% chance of NSBH or BBH. The HasNS and
HasRemnant fields will always show 100%.

Localization
------------

Sky localizations for early warning alerts are typically very coarse because
the early warning analysis inherently does not make use of the full duration
and bandwidth of the gravitational-wave signal. The localization improves
slowly up until the last second before merger, and then converges rapidly in
the last second.

The animations below taken from the data release [#DataRelease]_ show the
evolution of early-warning sky maps for three representative events with
different :term:`SNR` values. Note that this study assumed the detectors to be
operating at their final design sensitivity.
